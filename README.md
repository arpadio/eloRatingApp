# Arpadio - The Elo Rankings System App

A basic implementation of the Elo Rating System as a web app.

The app uses Firebase Database to update player ratings as they are affected by the results submitted.

Go ahead and play around - add new players to the ranking, and submit scores. The database can always be reset!

Feel free to submit issues and/or [pull requests](http://readwrite.com/2014/07/02/github-pull-request-etiquette/) at your leisure.

Go for it!  

### Roadmap

+ ~~Add results history for zero knowledge verification~~
+ ~~Ability to add new players~~
+ ~~Read and write from database~~
+ Include some form of authentication
+ Provision an independant instance easily
