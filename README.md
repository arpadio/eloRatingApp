# Arpadio - The Elo Rankings System App

A basic implementation of the Elo Rating System as a web app.

The app uses Firebase Database to update player ratings as they are changed by the results submitted.

Go ahead and play around - add new players to the ranking, and submit scores. The database can always be reset!

Feel free to submit issues and/or [pull requests](http://readwrite.com/2014/07/02/github-pull-request-etiquette/) at your leisure.
